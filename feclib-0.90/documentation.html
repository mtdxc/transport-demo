<h1>Forward Erasure Correction</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This code implements Forward Erasure Correction. This means that it will not
locate errors that occured during transmission, but it will regenerate any
packets the have been lost along the way.

<p>It consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is fed a stream of data
which it breaks up into packets. These packets can then be sent over an
unreliable transport mechanism, typically UDP. The decoder can then
reconstruct lost packets from redundant packets sent by the encoder.

<p>Like other implementations, the encoder groups n packets of payload
together and then adds k redundant packets to it. The receiver can only start
to reconstruct any of the lost payload once it has received at least n packets
in total.

<p>I wanted everything to be as clean as possible, with no fancy features.
Since it's open source, anyone is free to improve things as they see fit.
Contributions should start with the to do list at the end of this document.

<p>My intention was that it can be used in those cases where there is no back
channel e.g. one-way satellite link. So, if the library has been properly
configured, all data will be recovered, 
even if many megabytes is lost due to external events like thunder storms.

<h3>Parameters</h3>
This implementation uses band matrices (instead of Van Der Monde matrices)
for improved performance. It is extremely versatile, because it allows you to
set the following parameters :
<ol>
<li><b>s</b> the size of each packet, excluding headers. (See 5 below).
<li><b>n</b> the number of packets that are grouped together. This determines
   latency i.e. the receiver may end up having to wait until the whole group
   was received before it has enough data to output the first packet.
   Unless you have latency or memory concerns, you may as
   well set n to the number of packets you are sending.
   (See 3 below)
<li><b>k</b> the number of redundant packets sent for each group.
   k / (n + k) should preferrably be much higher than the the error rate of
   the transport mechanism on a per packet basis. Note that the k redundant
   packets are accessed very frequently, so it is advisible that k * s should
   be less than the amount of physical memory (RAM). Also note that as n gets
   smaller the chance to loose k of them increases (especially if there are
   burst losses), so n should be as large as possible. Usually the k * s
   will equal to the maximum expected amount of data that could be lost.
   <p>Maybe someone will write a function that uses probability models to
   work out the smallest suitable value of k...
<li><b>w</b> the width of the band in the band matrix. The larger w, the
   more processing power is needed. Typically 40 is a good default. In the
   unfortunate case that you loose a packet and all 40 redundant packets in
   its column, the reconstruction will fail. Fortunely
   these 41 packets are pseudo randomly distributed amoung the k + n packets
   so the chance of that happening is not great.
<li><b>g</b> The size of the Galois field is 2<sup>g</sup>. The
   computing time increases linearly with g
   (unlike other O(1) implementations).
   Because a field has only 1 element which does not have
   a multiplication inverse, the probability of not being able to find a
   spil element when we have k - i rows left to choose from is
   2<sup>-g * (k - i)</sup>. So a good value of g is 2, 3 or 4.
   s must be a multiple of g * 4.
<li><b>b</b> the number of bits per second that the encoder should limit the
   output to. This prevents network overload. Setting this to 0, implies that
   it should send as fast as possible.
</ol>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<pre>
fecEncoder *NewFecEncoder (void *userData,
  size_t (*userSend)(void *buf, size_t size, size_t count, void *userData),
  char **errorMessage,
  int s, int n, int k, int w, int g, int b);
</pre>
If it returns NULL, an error has occured. If you passed a non-NULL value in
errorMessage, *errorMessage will point to a string describing to you what
went wrong.
<pre>
void FecEncode (fecPayload *buf, fecEncoder *f);
</pre>
FecEncode must be called n times (or a multiple thereof), otherwise the
redundant data will not be sent.
<pre>
void DeleteFecEncoder (fecEncoder *f);

typedef struct fecDecoder;

fecDecoder *NewFecDecoder (void *userData, 
  void (*userReceive)(void *userData, __int64_t position, fecPayload *buf, int len)
);

size_t FecDecode (void *buf, size_t size, size_t count,
  fecDecoder *f);

void FlushFecDecoder (fecDecoder *f);
</pre>
The error correction works best if the decoder has the largest possible
amount of data. So you should call the flush command to signify that no more
data is expected e.g. after a timeout.
<pre>
void DeleteFecDecoder (fecDecoder *f);
</pre>

<h3>To Do list</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Implement sub channels</b> Currently we send a very large header
packet. Because we need it at the receiver, it must be sent with every
packets. 
<p>It consumes less bandwidth to implement a sub channel to send the 20 odd
bytes of control information :
Now the header is e.g. 2 bytes. The first bytes sends would be a simple
modulo 2<sup>8</sup> counter. The second byte would contain 1 byte of
control data if the first byte is less than 20, and would be a checksum byte
otherwise. This checksum scheme can also use Galois Fields and Gaussian
elimination, but it's parameters must chosen so that it will still function
under the worst possible error rates.
<li><b>Optimizations</b> 
<li><b>Packet checksum</b> Let the library send its own checksums incase the
UDP checksum still lets some bad packets get through.
<li><b>Non field rings</b> It is quite possible that there exists some
polynomials that are not primative, and the resultant ring is not a field, but
most of the ring is invertible, and they can be manipulated for even faster
operation. This needs to be investigated.
<li><b>Overflow of i</b> If more than 2 billion packets are send, problem may
occur. We need to fi this.
</ol>
